# WLMOnline
I've recently found out about [Escargot](escargot.log1p.xyz), a project to revive the now long dead MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger servers. This is a simple static webpage recreating the WLM 8.5 interface inspired by my time using it recently.

### See it in action on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/androidwg/full/XWXYZGb)

The entire interface uses the Tahoma font, also used on WLM and Windows versions prior to Windows 8. It should be installed on any modern Windows machine but I can't guarantee that.

All the assets have been extracted from WLM using Messenger Plus! and some have been edited lightly. It's still a quite incomplete and has no interactability whatsoever. I am willing to work on this as a frontend for anyone that wants to do the backend.
